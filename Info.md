# nakba


## steelman

A lot of bad thing happen in war. But even tough Israel killed palestininans. There is no proof of intent for any action that does not surround the protection of jews.  The same jews that were up to being anlihated in the same war. 

## default

The nakba is a result of multiple armies targeting Israel to is't full inalihation. Suggesting it as only an agression from Israel side is badfaith at worst and gaslight at best.

## hot hottake

The nakb is what you call the war you lost. If you've scucceded I would be inhalited. Stay mad.

nakba was a war where palestinians lead by hating jews. But now after being losers, they cry about it - "it was just a prank bro!".
